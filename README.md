# recovery-Convert-Macrium-to-Clonezilla
Use for when there's a driver issue preventing WinPE from restoring! Make a vm with an identical size disk image as the physical machine, then restore the Macrium image to it, then take a Clonezilla of this virtual disk to a network share. Now you can restore the computer using Clonezilla!
